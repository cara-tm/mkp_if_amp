h3. Examples

You will want some code similar to this in your individual article template header so that the amp page can be properly detected.

bc. <txp:if_individual_article>
 <link rel="canonical" href="<txp:permlink />">
 <link rel="amphtml" href="<txp:permlink />/amp/">
</txp:if_individual_article>

You will want something similar to this in your individual article template to display the alternative formatting.

bc. <txp:mkp_if_amp>
 <txp:output_form form="layout_archives_amp" />
<txp:else />
 <txp:output_form form="layout_archives_standard" />
</txp:_mkp_if_amp>

h3. TXP variable usage

A @<txp:variable name="amp" />@ with true/false value ("1" _or_ "0") is available to play with categories, page links:

bc. <txp:if_variable name="amp" value="1">
      ... Do some AMP things ...
      <a href="<txp:site_url />categorie/<txp:category name='<txp:category1 />' />?amp">AMP Category 1 Link</a>
    <txp:else />
      ... Do some normal things...
   </txp:if_variable>

This variable sniffs for a simple @?amp@ query in URLs without returning a 404 page.

h2. mkp_amp_redirect

A simple tag for web redirection to a subdomain name. Must be used with a mobiles detection script (i.e. adi_mobile plugin). <br>Some Web Designers could choose to use a subdomain for their mobiles websites (may be not recommanded. But the official AMP Blog is located into a subdomain, see: "https://amphtml.wordpress.com":https://amphtml.wordpress.com). In this case, the Textpattern multi-sites capacities makes things easier.

*Good advice*: 
Copy the @config.php@ file of the main site into the subdomain configuration folder. So, all articles written by the Copy editors will be sent automatically to the 'AMP powered website' from the usual Textpattern administration interface. Designers have a separate and cleaner space to built their AMP pages.

h3. Attributes

* @url@ _string_ (optional): The location (URL) of the website. Default: @hu@ (website URL set in the prefs panel).
* @subdomain@ _string_ (optional): Sets the subdomain name where to redirect to. Default: @amp@.

h3. Example

bc. <txp:mkp_amp_redirect subdomain="my" />

In this case, If your main domain is <code>example.com</code>, it redirects to the @my.example.com@ subdomain.
